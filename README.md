# Feature Engineering and EDA
In this project we would do some Feature engineering and Exploratory data analysis on popular kaggle datasets like Titanic.

We would carry out the analysis, feature engineering and dataplots in a separate notebook named xxxx-analysis and prediction/modelling in another and this would help us to focus on the objectives well. The datasets used and the output csv are attached under the project repository.
