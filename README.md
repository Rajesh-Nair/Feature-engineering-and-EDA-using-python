# Feature Engineering and EDA
In this project we would do some Feature engineering and Exploratory data analysis on popular kaggle datasets like Titanic.

We would split the work and carry out the analysis, feature engineering and dataplots in one notebook, and prediction/modelling in another notebook. This would help us to focus on the objectives well and the datasets used, the outputs are attached under the project repository.
